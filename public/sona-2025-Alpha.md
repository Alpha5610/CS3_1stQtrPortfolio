## **SONA 2025**

1. **KEY POINTS I FOUND INTERESTING**
* Around a million fishers and farmers were helped due to the rise of agricultural systems. 
* A lot of electricity is present in the Philippines. However, 5 million people don't have it, so electricity programs aim to implement more until the year 2028.
* "If a lot of money is for infrastructure, then MORE money will be for the Filipino citizens. 

2. **WEIRD POINTS**
* Senior high school students are encouraged to choose their desired course as early as now.
* A free track and field oval will be implemented.

### **REFLECTION**

This year's SONA tells us about the new programs, policies and resources required for our country's progression. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. 
has spoken up about the issues, and is now planning solutions. As a student, listening to this speech made me realize the many flaws 
in our country, but yet, it has also given me hope that our country could still improve for the better. In fact, with the numerous ideas 
(ranging from agricultural help to physical health support), I do believe that our country still has a lot to work with. 

Right now, I'll highlight the main problems - we start with agriculture, which is needed, of course. The SONA talks about how the farmers 
need more resources in order to complete their work immediately. The agricultural system will surely help Filipinos in gathering crops to 
make food for themselves. Then we have electricity, which is a problem for most people, since the use of technology is rising. We need 
electricity to be able to use gadgets; to check the news, to navigate our surroundings, and of course, to be at ease. Electricity is vital 
in survival, especially in today's generation. Lastly, we have health. According to the SONA, Filipinos suffering from illness don't get the 
help quickly. Health in general should be prioritized above all else, and the country's new plan is sure to make that happen. Truly, in my view,
 the SONA talks about a lot of positive plans that I hope are going to help the Philippines, one way or another.
